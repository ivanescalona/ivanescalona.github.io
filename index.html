Data Scientist and Chemistry major with hands on experience, combining good proficiency in coding and data analytics. I am currently enrolled in a prestigious Georgia Tech Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp, which has and continues to give me a great blend of fundamentals of Data Analytics with actual hands on training in the field. Academically I am currently enrolled at Georgia State University pursuing a BS in Computer Science, which couples very well with my BS in Chemistry from Simon Bolivar University in Venezuela, as the latter gave me great understanding on how to understand and unravel data and be able to effectively work with and extract the needed answers; and then both the Boot Camp and the BS Computer Science are enabling me to very fast and efficient develop the indispensable coding skills that every Data Scientist needs. I can code in a variety of languages, such as Java, Python, VBA, HTML, among others. I am avid for learning new things and improving upon what I have been learning; responsible; self-driven; reliable; and willing to move to a new role as a data scientist.
